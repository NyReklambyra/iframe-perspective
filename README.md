##Settings
Click the left side of the window to display the settings. From here you can change iframe src, the title, colors and iframe size and rotation. For more advanced settings, clone this project and go nuts.

##Develop
Developed using Compass, [install compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) and run `compass watch`. You can also make changes in `stylesheets/styles.css` (_but remember that this file will be overwritten whenever `sass/styles.scss` is compiled_).

##To-do
* Currently only compatible with webkit browsers.
* Better structure in `styles.scss`. Add comments.
* Optimize js
